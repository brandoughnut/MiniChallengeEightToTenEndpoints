Lab Name: MiniChallengeEightToTen - Endpoints
Brief Description: Created 3 different apis for mini challenges 8-10. Created 1 endpoint for magic 8 ball, 3 endpoints for guess it, and 1 endpoint for restaurant picker.
Peer Reviewer: Caleb Sylvia
Peer Review Comments: Everything works well and passes both swagger and postman. The only thing I would suggest is to take a parameter for the magic 8 ball and allow the user to directly input a question. Other than that everything looks and works well. Nice job!
